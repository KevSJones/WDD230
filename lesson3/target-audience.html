      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <h3>Nicole Larson - Buisness Owener</h3>
      <p>
        Nicole is 35 years old and owns a yoga studio. She is looking to find ways to connect to other businesses to help grow her small buisness. She feels that she is paying too much for her small office/studio and wants to compare options of other locations. She also wants to know of inexpensive ways to advertise that will reach mostly local people in the community. Nicole needs help finding a book keeping service so she can focus on her classes and not the paper work.
      </p>

He has a finance job that takes him into the city but he does most of his day to day buisness in the town of Avon. He and his wife have three active boys that he wants to get involved with community sports programs. His oldest wants to get an after school job and is looking for something close because he doesn't have his drivers license yet. </p>
