      <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This site is designed to help users book reservations for staying at the Temple Inn & Suites. The site will inform travelers about oher options and amminities that the company provides. There will be a list of locations and temples with services available. Services will include early check-in and changing area, rooms and suites, banquet/reception facillities, low-cost child care, and long-term temple missionary accomidations. It will be important to focus on a few specific temples that have the most need for out of town travelers. 
      </p>
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The main target audience would be people traveling longer than 6 hours in order to do temple work for themselves. Affordability will be a key factor for these people. 
        Another audience would be out of town wedding party members that need a place to stay near where the wedding will be taking place. 
        Someone looking to plan a wedding with relatives spread accross the globe could come to the site to coordinate everything that they needed. 
        The last group the site would try and reach would be senior temple missionaries needing affordable housing while serving in their calling.
