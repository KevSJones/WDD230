        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The main target audience would be people traveling longer than 6 hours in order to do temple work for themselves. Affordability will be a key factor for these people. 
        Another audience would be out of town wedding party members that need a place to stay near where the wedding will be taking place. 
        Someone looking to plan a wedding with relatives spread accross the globe could come to the site to coordinate everything that they needed. 
        The last group the site would try and reach would be senior temple missionaries needing affordable housing while serving in their calling.
